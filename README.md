# **Model Evaluation in Machine Learning: A Real-World Telecom Churn Prediction Case Study.**

## A Practical Guide to Better Models

TL;DR
Machine learning models are only as good as our ability to evaluate them. This case study walks through our journey of building a customer churn prediction system for a telecom company, where our initial model showed 85% accuracy in testing but plummeted to 70% in production. By implementing stratified k-fold cross-validation, addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, and focusing on business-relevant metrics beyond accuracy, we improved our production performance to 79% and potentially saved millions in customer retention. The article provides a practical, code-based roadmap for robust model evaluation that translates to real business impact.

Introduction: The Hidden Cost of Poor Evaluation
Have you ever wondered why so many machine learning projects fail to deliver value in production despite promising results during development? This frustrating discrepancy is rarely due to poor algorithms — it’s almost always because of inadequate evaluation techniques.

When our team built a customer churn prediction system for a major telecommunications provider, we learned this lesson the hard way. Our initial model showed an impressive 85% accuracy during testing, creating excitement among stakeholders. However, when deployed to production, performance dropped dramatically to 70% — a gap that translated to millions in potential lost revenue.

This article documents our journey of refinement, highlighting the specific evaluation techniques that transformed our model from a laboratory success to a business asset. We’ll share code examples, project structure, and practical insights that you can apply to your own machine learning projects.

The Problem: Why Traditional Evaluation Falls Short
The Deceptive Nature of Simple Metrics
For our telecom churn prediction project, the business goal was clear: identify customers likely to cancel their service so the retention team could intervene. However, our evaluation approach suffered from several critical flaws:

Over-reliance on accuracy: With only 20% of customers actually churning, a model that simply predicted “no churn” for everyone would achieve 80% accuracy while being completely useless.
Simple train/test splitting: Our initial random split didn’t preserve the class distribution across partitions.
Data leakage: Some preprocessing steps were applied before splitting the data.
Ignoring business context: We initially optimized for accuracy instead of recall (identifying as many potential churners as possible).
